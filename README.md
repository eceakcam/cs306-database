# cs306-database


In this Project step, first we created all our tables from localhost website. Under our database called “Project_306” we created 5 tables. After that, we wrote some imaginary data and added them into our tables.
In step 2, we implement a web panel that we can access all our tables. First, we tried to create navigation bar to control everything. After that we created welcome page. We did simple page for welcoming. Other step that we made was adding the images. Lastly, we tried to connect our tables with navigation bar. Furthermore, we created insert, delete, and select operations.
We made a relation which shows which customers bought which spesific product. When user select a product id it shows who bought.
